Thanks for checking out the readme!



INITAL SETUP

To get this working, you will need to download 2 Blender addons, enable them, and change kspdir to the installation location of Kerbal Space Program

1. Click "Download ZIP," unzip the archive, then place the whole folder into the Blender Addons folder (Blender Foundation\Blender\2.73\scripts\addons)
2. Download the .mu importer from https://github.com/taniwha-qf/io_object_mu, and place the unzipped folder in the same location
3. Find KSP.exe (look in Steam\Steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program)
4. Copy the directory name
5. Paste it directly into kspdir.txt and save
6. In Blender, press CTRL+ALT+U, go to Addons, and enable this addon. It is called "Import-Export: KSPBlender .craft Import"
7. Either click "Save User Settings" or come back and enable the addon every time you want to use it.
8. Enjoy!



MOD PARTS

Thanks to Cptman's hard work, there is now a function to procedurally find parts... which means that every mod is now supported.
However, many parts may import with the wrong scale or be slightly misplaced. Please report any scaling or location issues!
